## Controller
While the go-socket server is listening to the target address and port, it can handle different requests by routing them to different controllers and actions.
We can create controllers inherited from `gosocket.Controller` to handle requests made by the clients. Here is an example of `ChatController` in `chat.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	gosocket "github.com/yankawayu/go-socket"
)

type ChatController struct {
	gosocket.Controller
}

type AddMessageReqBody struct {
	Message string `json:"message"`
}

func (controller *ChatController) GetActionParamMap() map[string]interface{} {
	return map[string]interface{}{
		"AddMessage": &AddMessageReqBody{},
	}
}

func (controller *ChatController) AddMessage(request *AddMessageReqBody, response *gosocket.ResponseBody) {
	fmt.Println(request.Message)
	response.Data = map[string]string{
		"message_id": "1",
	}
	response.Status = gosocket.StatusSuccess
}
```
In this class, the `GetActionParamMap` function is used to declare all the actions that can be handled by the controller.
Then we add this `ChatController` to the router by inserting a new line to `example.go`:
```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/yankawayu/go-socket"
)

func main() {
	appConfig := &gosocket.AppConfig{
		TcpAddr:   "0.0.0.0",
		TcpPort:   8080,
		TlsEnable: false,
	}
	fastLog := gosocket.GetFastLog("app.access", false)
	//Add ChatController to the router
	gosocket.Router("chat", &ChatController{})
	gosocket.Run(appConfig, nil, gosocket.GetLog(false), fastLog)
}
```

It is recommended that the router name `chat` is the same as the prefix of `ChatController`. Now we can access to the `AddMessage` action by using payload type `chat.AddMessage` in a client request.

If you want to run these two files in command line, you need to add `chat.go` to the file list:

```sh
go build example.go chat.go
```

## Client
Go-socket has a built-in client. It's implemented by socket_client.go and socket_client_conn.go. Let's create a `client.go` that can be used to connect to the server we just created in the last section.
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	gosocket "github.com/yankawayu/go-socket"
)

func main() {
	client := gosocket.NewClient("127.0.0.1", 8080, false, gosocket.GetLog(false), nil)
	err := client.Connect()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	client.GetData("chat.AddMessage", map[string]string{
		"message": "test",
	}, func(err error, data string) {
		fmt.Println(data)
	}, []byte{})
	//Stop the client from exiting before the server responds
	forever := make(chan int)
	_ = <-forever
}
```
The client first connect to the server and then send a request on `chat.AddMessage`. If everything goes well, you will see the server response printed in the console:

```json
{"message_id":"1"}
```

## Auth
In the example above, there is no identification when the client connects to server. In fact, you can create a class that inherited from `AuthUser` to implement identification process as following:
```go
import (
	gosocket "github.com/yankawayu/go-socket"
	"github.com/yankawayu/go-socket/packet"
)

type TestUser struct {
	gosocket.AuthUser
}

func (user *TestUser) Auth(payload string, ip string) (uid int64, code packet.ReturnCode) {
	loginInfo := map[string]string{
		"username": "xxx",
		"password": "xxx",
	}
	gosocket.JSONDecode(payload, &loginInfo)
	uid = auth(loginInfo["username"], loginInfo["password"])
	return uid, packet.RetCodeAccepted
}
```
Please keep in mind that `auth` function is unimplemented. You should implement this function to perform the identification process. It is not recommended to use username and password in production environment design. Feel free to use any mechanism you want.

After you finish defining the auth class, use it to run the server like the following code:
```go
gosocket.Run(appConfig, &TestUser{}, gosocket.GetLog(false), fastLog)
```

## Error Handling
There is an interface `IUserError` for user defined error in `error.go`. Implement this interface in your custom error class to customize messages that responded to the client.

## Log
There are two log utilities in the framework. One is called `Log` and another is called `FastLog`. The `Log` is used to log normal situations like error and critical since it's not efficient enough. While the `FastLog` can be used to log all the incoming requests or any other high frequent demands. Feel free to use them in your own situations.

## Build an IM Server
The ultimate goal of this project is to support a high performance IM server developed by Go. I would like to release all related codes in the future.
Hope it helps.
